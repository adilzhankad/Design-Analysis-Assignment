# Design-Analysis-Assignment
Learning goals • Implement classic divide-and-conquer algorithms with safe recursion patterns • Analyze running-time recurrences using Master Theorem (3 cases) and Akra–Bazzi intuition; validate with measurements. • Collect metrics (time, recursion depth, comparisons/allocations) and communicate results via a short report and clean Git history.
